## Definitions

### Probability distributions

* Provides the probabilities of the occurence of various possible outcomes in an experiment


#### Normal Distributions

#### The binomial distribution

* Describes the numbers of particular outcomes in a sequence of n Bernoulli trials  (n independent experiments, each of which can yied exactly two possible outcomes 
* Each outcome has a fixed probability ,the same from trial to trial
* if the probability of a single particular outcome is p, the probablity that such a sequence of trials yields exactly k such outcomes is
